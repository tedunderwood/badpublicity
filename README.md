# badpublicity
Code, data, and blog post supporting a presentation at MLA 2020 in Seattle, "There's No Such Thing as Bad Publicity: Toward a Distant Reading of Reception."

The "toward" in the title signals that this is a teaser presentation on work in progress rather than an argument about results of a completed experiment. So this repo does not contain a fully reproducible workflow--just some pieces of the workflow that may help document "which books I'm talking about." Specifically, we're talking about 8,034 books described in *Book Review Digest* between 1916 and 1930.

The core script here is '''publisher_analysis.py'''. This works on raw data (not provided here) to produce '''allbooks.tsv''', '''publishers.tsv''', and '''publisher_books.tsv'''. The talk is chiefly based on the last of these three files.
